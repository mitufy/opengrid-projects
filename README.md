A place to store my OpenSCAD projects for openGrid.

### opengrid_parametric_snap.scad [customizer](https://makerworld.com/en/models/1680432-opengrid-snap-generator)
A generator for openGrid snaps and Multiconnect connectors. The focus is to recreate David's official snaps while exposing as many parameters as possible. I hope this can be helpful for openGrid users, either to design their own snaps or simply to make use of the snap geometry.

### opengrid_expanding_snap.scad [customizer](https://makerworld.com/en/models/1412027-opengrid-Multiconnect-self-expanding-snap)
A generator for self-expanding snaps. The code is mostly the same as opengrid_parametric_snap.scad, with has a simplified customizer used solely for self-expanding snaps.

### Multiconnect_gadget_hook.scad [customizer](https://makerworld.com/en/models/1771774-opengrid-Multiconnect-hook-gadget-generator)
A generator for openGrid hooks, which are attached to the openGrid board via Multiconnect snaps. When paired with self-expanding snaps, it provides reasonable strength while being space- and filament-efficient.

### opengrid_framefit_hook.scad [customizer](https://makerworld.com/en/models/1586090-opengrid-lite-hook-generator)
A generator for openGrid hooks, which are attached to the frame of the openGrid board, in the style of David's [minimal hook](https://www.printables.com/model/1217962-opengrid-minimal-hook).

### Multiconnect_hex_bit.scad [customizer](https://makerworld.com/en/models/1412021-opengrid-Multiconnect-6-35mm-hex-bit)
A generator for the Multiconnect hex bit. It can also function as a general coin screwdriver.
