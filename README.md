A place to store my OpenSCAD projects for openGrid.

### opengrid_parametric_snap.scad [(online customizer)](https://makerworld.com/en/models/1680432-opengrid-snap-generator)
A generator for openGrid snaps and Multiconnect connectors. The focus is to recreate David's official snaps while exposing as many parameters as possible. I hope this can be helpful for openGrid users, either to design their own snaps or simply to make use of the snap geometry.

### opengrid_expanding_snap.scad [(online customizer)](https://makerworld.com/en/models/1412027-opengrid-multiconnect-self-expanding-snap)
A generator for self-expanding snaps. The code is mostly the same as opengrid_parametric_snap.scad, with has a simplified customizer used solely for self-expanding snaps.

### opengrid_framefit_hook.scad [(online customizer)](https://makerworld.com/en/models/1586090-opengrid-lite-hook-generator)
A generator for openGrid hooks, in the style of David's minimal hook. It attachs to the frame of the openGrid board, hence the name.

### multiconnect_hex_bit.scad [(online customizer)](https://makerworld.com/en/models/1412021-opengrid-multiconnect-6-35mm-hex-bit)
A generator for the multiconnect hex bit. It can also function as a general coin screwdriver.
